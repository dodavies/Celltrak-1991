This is the old celltrak.exe software for the 4500x 
aka motorola joan interface

This allowed the user to use an off the shelf motorola phone with modification to intercept calls on the tacs cellular network back in the early nineties.
The Transportable must be the 4500x type with two circuit boards i.e the thicker version the newer 4800 board is not the same.
The only way to see it working today is with osmocom-analog and an old computer with a paralell port
